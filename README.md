This project is thoroughly documented on its [Hackaday Project page](https://hackaday.io/project/187258-repurposing-an-accom-axial-control-panel). This repository merely stores the code for it.

## TO DO

... and misc. ideas

* TODO Implement a "KSP Mode" to provide a controller for Kerbal Space program; this can be achieved e.g. by using the kRPC library as in the [KSP Gegi](https://hackaday.io/project/8891-ksp-gegi) controller.
* [Custom "waterslide" decals for keycaps](https://old.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/nncx59/how_to_diy_custom_print_keycaps_using_waterslide/)
